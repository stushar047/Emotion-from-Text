Text sentiment analysis through a natural language processing has many applications including reviewing social media status, customer satisfaction of a product etc. One of those applications involves predicting either a movie has made a positive and negative impact of peopleâ€™s mind without reading the whole review. Hadi et al. has argued how to develop movie review classifier (both binary and multi-scale) using existing machine learning algorithm in [1]. Another paper was reviewed on short massage sentiment analysis based on BOW (bag of word) model and random forest classifier [2]. The main objective of this project is to review naive bayes and random forest classifier using BOW model and BOW+Wod2Vec model and this whole work is very much inspired by these two works
